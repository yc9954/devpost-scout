## Body

fweelts User Interface fweelts User Interface fweelts User Interface fweelts User Interface fweelts User Interface fweelts User Interface fweelts User Interface Inspiration Twitter 🐦 API is a powerful resource of information 💾. We thought that Elastic search can definitely do cool stuff with this type of data. 🤓 We mixed in some of our data science knowledge and decided to create a web app that fetches sentiment and emotion-related data of tweets. What it does fweelts takes a keyword from the user, fetches relevant tweets using the Twitter Search API and stores them in Elastic search. Thereafter, appropriate queries are made to elastic which are sent to pre-trained machine learning models to perform sentiment and emotional analysis. 🔎🔎 Features Show the number of tweets with a particular sentiment value as well as from the English language. Show the number of tweets with a particular emotion value. Show the different sources of tweets and the distribution of tweets in the data. Wordcloud indicating the most common words inside tweets. All the above features can be performed separately for tweets containing a particular keyword. How we built it We decided what stack we want to use and quickly set things up. ⛏️ We wrote functions for Twitter API (using Tweepy) as well as Elasticsearch (using its Python API) We set up Dash and placed function call at relevant places. We spun off a FastAPI server 🏢 and configured it to execute pre-trained models from HuggingFace. We set up Dash to make calls to the server and subsequently write the data back to Elastic search. We wrote Elastic search queries for different tasks such as aggregation and filter. We created various visualisations to show the results back to the user. Challenges we ran into We had to figure out how to integrate Dash to allow using Twitter API and Elastic search. For machine learning models, we couldn't work with Dash alone so we quickly had to spin up a FastAPI server. We had to understand how to use Elasticsearch's Python wrapper. Documentation wasn't extensive here. We wanted to do more with aggregations and therefore had to spend a lot of time reading documentation and exploring things like an aggregation pipeline. Our PCs fried up with elastic, kibana, dash and FastAPI server hogged up with models running all at once. Working was painfully slow. Accomplishments that we're proud of We quickly learned so much and assembled everything in a time crunch. We knew nothing about elastic before, except for the fact that it's a mere buzzword. Now we're comfortable using it in any future project or work. We combined several technologies and got them to work together. What we learned What elastic is, its use cases, setting it up and navigating its documentation. How to use Dash to plot visualizations. How to use pre-trained models from HuggingFace and integrating them to our service. What's next for fweelts - Feel the tweets There's a lot of scope to increase the amount of visualisation that can be done. More data can be fetched from a twitter API and an enhanced schema can be created. Some optimization to improve the working time. Deploying fweelts on the web for everyone to use.
