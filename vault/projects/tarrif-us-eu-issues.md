## Body

ZLINGO: The Ultimate GenZ Rizz Engine 🌲 Inspiration The inspiration for ZLINGO came from a simple observation: the "generational gap" is moving faster than ever. In the age of TikTok and rapid-fire internet lore, slang changes weekly. We noticed that many people—from older millennials to non-native speakers—felt "mid" or "cringe" because they couldn't keep up with the vibe. We wanted to build a tool that didn't just act as a dictionary, but as a Live Coach that could help anyone master the "rizz" of modern conversation in a fun, low-stakes environment. ⚙️ What it does ZLINGO is a dual-threat AI agent platform: Live Rizz Coach : A real-time voice agent (Z-Coach) that uses Amazon Nova 2 Sonic to have high-energy conversations. It listens to your tone, slang, and "aura," providing instant feedback on how to sound more like a GenZ legend. Meme Decoder : A multimodal engine where you can upload any meme. It breaks down the deep lore, explains the humor, and gives it a "Rizz Rating" using Amazon Nova 2 Lite . Contextual Handoff : The coolest part—you can decode a meme and then immediately jump into a voice chat with Z-Coach about that specific meme. The AI remembers the context, making the learning loop seamless. 🧱 How we built it We built ZLINGO using a modern full-stack approach: Frontend : React 18 with a "Vibe-First" UI design. We used Tailwind CSS for glassmorphism and neon aesthetics, and Framer Motion for those "silky smooth" transitions. AI Core : We leveraged the AWS SDK for JavaScript to connect to two powerful models: amazon.nova-2-sonic-v1:0 for the low-latency voice experience. amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0 for lightning-fast multimodal meme analysis. Audio Engineering : We implemented a custom PCM encoding/decoding pipeline using the Web Audio API . We built a scheduled playback system to ensure that Nova's voice responses were gapless and natural. Deployment : The entire app is hosted on AWS App Runner , providing a scalable and reliable environment for our agents. 🧗 Challenges we ran into The "Glitch" Boss : Handling real-time audio in a browser is notoriously difficult. We initially faced "clicking" sounds and overlapping audio. We had to dive deep into the Web Audio API to implement a precise scheduling system based on audioContext.currentTime . Latency vs. Quality : We wanted the Meme Decoder to be instant. We optimized the image payloads and used the Amazon Nova 2 Lite model to ensure the "lore" was delivered in under 2 seconds. Contextual Memory : Passing the "lore" from the Meme Decoder to the Live Coach required careful management of systemInstructions to ensure the transition felt natural and not robotic. 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of The Vibe : We managed to create a UI that actually feels like GenZ culture—chaotic, vibrant, and high-energy—rather than a boring corporate tool. Zero-Latency Feel : The voice interaction feels incredibly responsive. When Z-Coach calls you out for being "cringe" in real-time, it’s a genuinely funny and immersive experience. Multimodal Synergy : Successfully bridging the gap between an image analysis tool and a voice agent was a major win for us. 📚 What we learned Amazon Nova is a Game Changer : The ability to have a persistent connection for voice opens up entirely new categories of apps. It’s not just a chatbot; it’s a presence. Audio Scheduling is Key : We learned that for live agents, the "playback" side is just as important as the "generation" side. Precise timing is what makes an AI feel human. Slang is Hard : Even for an AI, keeping up with "Skibidi" lore is a challenge! We learned how to prompt Nova to stay in character without losing its helpfulness. 🔭 What's next for ZLINGO Multiplayer Rizz Battles : Imagine two users competing to see who has the most "aura" in a live-coached debate. Real-Time Video Analysis : Expanding the Live Coach to analyze your facial expressions and body language via the camera to give "Aura Feedback." Community Lore Database : A user-contributed library of decoded memes that creates a living encyclopedia of internet culture. ZLINGO Mobile : Bringing the rizz coach to your pocket for real-world "vibe checks" on the go. Built with ❤️ for the Amazon Nova Hackathon <div
