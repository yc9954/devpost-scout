## Body

Home page Description of aircraft to create 3D preview List of aircraft that has been created AR scene 1 AR scene 2 AR scene 3 AR scene 4 Score Leaderboard by player All scores Inspiration Most 3D design tools are desktop-first and heavy. I wanted a phone-first workflow to sketch an idea, iterate quickly with AI, view it in AR, and then play with it—without a workstation or VR setup. What it does Aircraft Studio is a mobile-focused studio for prototyping and testing aircraft: Create/select an aircraft in the Hangar Use text prompts to guide design decisions Generate concept images fast (Fireworks Flux 1) Convert images to lightweight 3D ( .glb ) for quick previews (Spar 3D) Review and enter an AR simulation to fly, shoot, and clear waves Submit runs to a global leaderboard backed by MongoDB Share a QR code for quick mobile access Current prototype focuses on the home page, Hangar flow, and a responsive AR-style kinematic simulation loop. How I built it Frontend: Next.js (mobile-first UI) Auth: Auth0 (optional; guest mode supported) Data: MongoDB Atlas for global leaderboard Client storage: IndexedDB for local model blobs ( aircraft-studio/models ) AI integrations: Groq for engineering prompt assistance, name and stats extraction Fireworks Flux 1 for image generation Spar 3D for image-to-3D conversion AR approach: WebXR-style camera + anchored model preview; kinematic motion loop optimized for phones Sponsor tracks Groq: Prompt-engineering endpoint powers aircraft stats and naming in src/pages/api/prompt-engineering.js . Windsurf: Built and iterated entirely in an AI‑native IDE workflow to accelerate feature delivery. Worked as a solo, and 70~80% of the code came from vibe coding. MongoDB Atlas: Backs the global leaderboard with server-side queries ( src/pages/leaderboard.js , src/lib/mongodb.js ). Auth0: Optional Google login enables authenticated run submissions; guest play remains supported. Technical highlights Supporting both iOS and Android via web browser without app install required Mobile-first UX: touch-first controls, small UI footprint, quick iteration Kinematic flight model: responsive motion without full aero sim Smoothed velocity targets, clamped rates, joystick-driven yaw/pitch/roll Lightweight effects: audio cues and hit markers to keep FPS high on phones Telemetry scaffolding: documented event shapes for sessions, frames, collisions, and gameplay—designed for batched posting and on-device sampling Enhanced prompt with Groq, text to image with Flux 1, and image to 3D with Spar 3D Challenges Balancing realism vs. responsiveness for phone AR Setting up the physical engine for the AR mode, making the jet move, rotation, attack, enemy jets, applying stats, etc. Making the pipeline “fast enough to iterate”: prompt → image → .glb → preview → play Keeping the stack simple while leaving room for AI/3D integrations Accomplishments I’m proud of A clean, phone-first flow that gets from idea to playable prototype quickly A leaderboard that works with or without login (submission requires auth) Clear telemetry schema for future tuning and analytics A pragmatic AR loop that performs well on mid-range devices What I learned How far you can get with kinematics before needing full aero Practicalities of local caching (IndexedDB) for heavy model blobs The tradeoffs of optional auth in a game-like flow What’s next Physics: optional gravity, basic lift and drag, simple stall modelling Collisions: convex hulls or per-part hitboxes AI: tighter integration with Groq + Flux 1 for “design and iterate” loops 3D: more robust Spar 3D conversion and materials pipeline Multiplayer: shared anchors for basic dogfights Deeper analytics: flight envelopes, trim curves, auto-tuning from telemetry Try it locally Requirements Node.js 18+ macOS/Chrome recommended for camera permissions 1) Clone and install: git clone https://github.com/YehyunLee/aircraft-studio.git cd aircraft-studio npm install 2) Add environment variables in .env.local (see README.md for details): AUTH0_DOMAIN , AUTH0_CLIENT_ID , AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET , AUTH0_SECRET , APP_BASE_URL MONGODB_URI , MONGODB_DB , NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL , etc. You can run as a guest without Auth0, but leaderboard submission requires login. MongoDB is needed for leaderboard to function. 3) Start the dev server with HTTPS (needed for camera/AR): npx next dev --experimental-https Built with Next.js Auth0 MongoDB IndexedDB Groq Fireworks Flux 1 Spar 3D WebXR <div
