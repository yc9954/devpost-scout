Gradio App Gradio App FabMi: Exploring LLM Fine-Tuning for Semiconductor Defect Analysis Inspiration A Gap Between Detection and Understanding In semiconductor manufacturing, AI-powered defect detection has matured significantly—vision systems can classify defect patterns with high accuracy. However, the reasoning step that follows remains largely manual: understanding why a defect occurred and how to fix it. This root cause analysis (RCA) typically requires experienced process engineers who can: Correlate subtle patterns: "Wafers 3, 5, 7, 9 affected → likely FOUP slot contamination" Apply domain knowledge: "RF-hours approaching 3,000 → check O-ring condition" Recommend specific actions: "Inspect part P/N 839-0234, verify leak rate" With the semiconductor industry growing toward $1 trillion and experienced engineers becoming scarce, I was curious: Could a small, fine-tuned LLM learn to assist with this reasoning task? This project was my exploration of that question. What I Built FabMi is a fine-tuned ERNIE-4.5-0.3B model that generates structured root cause analysis reports for semiconductor wafer defects. Given a defect observation and process context, it produces outputs like: ## Root Cause Analysis **Primary Cause**: O-ring seal degradation in etch chamber - RF-hours (2,847) approaching 3,000-hour limit - Edge-ring pattern suggests gas leakage at chamber seal ## Corrective Actions 1. **Immediate**: Tool down ETCH-LAM-07 2. **Inspect**: Main chamber O-ring for degradation 3. **Replace**: O-ring P/N 839-0234 (Viton, ID 350mm) 4. **Verify**: Leak rate < 1 mTorr/min after replacement **Severity**: Critical | **Yield Impact**: 15% Results I compared the fine-tuned 0.3B model against a zero-shot 21B baseline on a held-out test set: Metric Baseline (21B zero-shot) FabMi (0.3B fine-tuned) ROUGE-L 0.063 0.446 ROUGE-1 0.101 0.561 ROUGE-2 0.028 0.282 Severity Accuracy 20.0% 60.0% Structure Score 35.5% 88.0% The results suggest that domain-specific fine-tuning can help smaller models perform reasonably well on specialized tasks, even compared to larger models used zero-shot. How I Built It 1. Synthetic Data Generation Real semiconductor RCA data is proprietary and hard to obtain. I created synthetic training data using multiple LLMs (Claude, Gemini, GPT, Grok) to ensure diversity: $$\mathcal{D} = \bigcup_{i \in {\text{sources}}} \mathcal{D}_i$$ I generated 1,511 samples across 9 defect types: Defect Pattern Samples Example Root Cause Edge-Ring 242 Seal degradation Donut 186 Edge ring wear Center 180 Showerhead issues Scratch 174 Mechanical damage Edge-LOC 162 Chuck contamination Random 158 Particle sources LOC 152 Localized contamination Near-Full 147 Process failures None 110 Normal baseline Each sample captures domain-specific reasoning patterns, such as: Input: "Wafers 3,5,7,9 affected, slots 1,2,4,6,8 clean" Reasoning: Odd-slot pattern → FOUP-side contamination (not robot arm, which would show sequential pattern) 2. Fine-Tuning with LoRA I used LLaMA-Factory to fine-tune ERNIE-4.5-0.3B-PT with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): $$W' = W_0 + BA$$ Where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$, with rank $r = 16$. Training setup: Base model : baidu/ERNIE-4.5-0.3B-PT LoRA config : rank=16, alpha=32 Learning rate : $5 \times 10^{-5}$ with cosine decay Training : 10 epochs Data split : 90/10 train/test (1,356 / 155 samples) The resulting LoRA adapter is only 24MB , making it easy to share and deploy. 3. Evaluation Approach I evaluated using multiple metrics to capture different aspects of output quality: ROUGE scores : Measure textual overlap with reference outputs Severity accuracy : Whether the model correctly classifies Critical/Major/Minor Structure score : Presence of expected sections (Root Cause, Corrective Actions, etc.) $$S_{\text{structure}} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{1}[\text{section}_i \in \text{output}]$$ Challenges Faced Challenge 1: Training Data Scarcity Problem : Semiconductor RCA data is proprietary and not publicly available. Solution : I used multiple LLMs to generate diverse synthetic training samples, encoding domain-specific reasoning patterns based on publicly available semiconductor process knowledge. Challenge 2: Output Format Consistency Problem : LLMs often produce inconsistent formats, making downstream integration difficult. Solution : I used consistent Alpaca-style formatting across all training samples: { "instruction": "Analyze semiconductor defect...", "input": "Defect observation + process context", "output": "Structured markdown RCA report" } This achieved 88% structure score on the test set. Challenge 3: Evaluation Design Problem : No standard benchmark exists for semiconductor RCA evaluation. Solution : I designed a multi-metric evaluation framework: ROUGE scores for textual quality Severity classification accuracy Structure score for format compliance Challenge 4: Efficient Model Selection Problem : Balancing model capability with deployment efficiency. Solution : LoRA fine-tuning on ERNIE-4.5-0.3B achieved strong results while keeping the adapter size at just 24MB—practical for real-world deployment. What I Learned Domain-specific fine-tuning is effective : A small model with targeted training data can perform well on specialized tasks, even compared to larger models used zero-shot. Multi-source synthetic data works : Using multiple LLMs to generate diverse training data helped create a robust dataset covering various reasoning patterns. Structure can be learned : Consistent formatting in training data translated to reliable structured outputs (88% structure score). LoRA enables practical deployment : The 24MB adapter size makes it feasible to share and deploy without heavy infrastructure.
