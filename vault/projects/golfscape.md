## Body

Inspiration As an avid golfer I always appreciate when courses have a fly through drone tour of their course. This allows me to experience the course prior to booking and get a feel for the course design. The problem is that very few courses provide this so the Google Maps 3D API was the perfect tool to solve this issue. What it does Golfscape allows golfers a quick and informative tour of golf courses prior to their time on the course. On top of just viewing the course we were able to go one step further with the API and create 3D markers for various points of interest such as the tee boxes, bunkers, water hazards, and greens with real distances. This allows for the golfer to not only see the course but begin to plan how to attack each hole before they even arrive at the course. How we built it For the frontend platform we used Sveltekit and TailwindCSS. The map and fly throughs were created using the Google Maps 3D API. The course data was retrieved manually using Google Maps/Course websites as well as the Golf API. Current weather data was retrieved using the OpenWeather API. Challenges we ran into Most of the challenges we ran into fell into 2 categories: API limitations and unfamiliarity with SvelteKit. This was Ethan’s first time deploying a SvelteKit app so there was a bit of a learning curve with how to organize code, manage state, and import data. These were not too hard to overcome with the help of Google and Gabe’s experience to fall back on. The API limitations were more of a core issue. We used most every part of the 3D Maps functionality, but we didn’t have the full control of the camera like we wanted. The flyCameraTo function was great, but didn’t have a way to customize the path to follow a curve rather than a straight line. Also, the camera tilt was heavily influenced by the altitude and range as it would fly over the course which caused some weird behaviors (zooming in and out between path points). We managed to ovecome this by creating custom altitudes through trial and error for each course and for each hole. While tedious, this allowed us to create a smooth flight path for each hole. Accomplishments that we're proud of We are very proud of the interactions and visualizations we were able to achieve despite the somewhat limited camera controls. We were also able to integrate other APIs that gave us golf and weather data for added user value. As a golfer I am actually excited to use this for my next round! If we continue to work on this I believe we can create a very useful tool for golfers. What we learned We learned to use the Google 3D Maps API and integrate it into Svelte. Since it is a pure javascript api we can use it in React and Angular apps in the future the same way too. Through using the api, we created algorithms to calculate optimal ranges for the different paths as well as the correct heading calculations for a smooth animation. We also learned much more about the golf courses themselves and what rich data is available in the golf world. What's next for GolfScape Draw topographical contours on map to account for elevation changes Optimal path planning based on course layout and par AI caddy tips about how to play a hole Mobile-optimizations Export video functionality for clubs to use in marketing Automated course import (color detection to get coordinates of features) <div
