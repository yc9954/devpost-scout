## Body

CCFV (CrossChain Funding and Voting) is a cutting-edge platform that revolutionizes how funding and decision-making cross over multiple blockchain ecosystems. At its core, CCFV enables project creators to launch funding campaigns on a primary blockchain while seamlessly integrating with various other blockchains. The platform empowers users from different networks to participate in funding and governance, making the process truly decentralized and inclusive. CCFV at the moment is running on 6 blockchains (Sepolia, Fuji, Mumbai, BNB Testnet, Base, Optimism); using Chainlink CCIP, Functions, Automation and Price Feeds. The Problem Ethereum Mainnet is often the preferred layer for long-term fund storage due to its robust security and wide acceptance. However, high gas fees on Ethereum can significantly erode small donations, with costs sometimes surpassing the donation amount itself. Let's imagine Ava; she is willing to donate $5, but the fluctuating gas fees, ranging from 20% to 100%, make it impractical on Ethereum. If she donates $5, most of it will go to the gas fees and very small if not non, will be an actual donation. With mass participation, the proportion of funds wasted on gas could become substantial, detracting from the intended charitable impact. We need a solution to allow users to donate with less gas fees. Now let's imagine Frank; he prefers Avalanche for its low fees and fast transactions, but his donations are lost to a project anchored solely on Ethereum. Mark and Britney face similar issues with their favored chains, Polygon and BNB Chain respectively. Imagine the miss of donations on all these different chains if we process on only 1 blockchain. We can create multiple donation contracts on different blockchains; but setting up isolated funding contracts on different chains leads to fragmented pools of funds and diluted impact. The split in balance can reduce the visibility and attractiveness of the funding campaign. The challenge of decentralized voting is compounded by high costs and the need for a trustless system to aggregate votes. Here comes CCFV; leveraging Chainlink CCIP, bridges the gap by connecting donations and votes across multiple chains. It enables a collective funding pool with lower overheads and a decentralized voting mechanism, maximizing efficiency and engagement. Usage of Chainlink CCIP CCFV leverages Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enable seamless communication and data transfer across different blockchains. The utilization of CCIP is fundamental to CCFV's success in aggregating donations and votes from various blockchain communities onto a primary Ethereum mainnet contract. Through CCIP, CCFV minimizes gas fees, ensures data integrity, and enhances the overall efficiency of cross-chain transactions. Usage of Chainlink Automation CCFV leverages Chainlink Automation to automate and streamline CCIP bridging process at predefined intervals. Chainlink Automation ensures the timely and efficient execution of data transfers from Node Contracts to the Master Contract. This automation eliminates the need for manual intervention, reducing the risk of delays and enhancing the overall reliability of CCFV's cross-chain operations. Usage of Chainlink Functions CCFV relies on Chainlink Functions to facilitate the smooth retrieval of proposal IDs from the master contract into secondary node contracts across various blockchains. Usage of Chainlink Price Feeds CCFV employs Chainlink Price Feeds to dynamically calculate the create proposal fee in ETH and LINK on-chain. By leveraging Chainlink's reliable and decentralized price oracle network, CCFV ensures accurate and up-to-date conversion rates between ETH and LINK. This integration allows for real-time fee adjustments based on market fluctuations, providing a fair and transparent mechanism for determining proposal creation costs. Technologies Chainlink CCIP to bridge funds and votes from node contracts to the master contract Chainlink Functions to get latest proposal id from master contract to sync to node contracts Chainlink Automation to automate CCIP bridging Chainlink PriceFeeds to use payable function with LINK value TheGraph for event indexing and frontend usage React for frontend Inspiration CCFV (CrossChain Funding and Voting) is inspired by the evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. We were motivated to address the challenges faced by traditional funding models and existing Web3 platforms. Our vision is to bring together various blockchain communities, allowing individuals, regardless of their blockchain preference, to easily take part in funding campaigns and governance processes. What it does CCFV (CrossChain Funding and Voting) is a revolutionary platform that redefines decentralized funding and decision-making in the blockchain space. At its core, CCFV unites various blockchain communities, allowing project creators to launch funding campaigns on a primary blockchain while seamlessly interacting with multiple other blockchains. The platform enables users from different networks to participate in funding initiatives and governance processes without the limitations of traditional multi-chain environments. Leveraging Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), CCFV efficiently aggregates donations and votes from different blockchains, providing a transparent, cost-effective, and inclusive solution. By bridging the gaps between blockchains, CCFV ensures that funds and votes are accessible to a global audience, fostering collaboration, trust, and collective impact. How we built it && Challenges we ran into CCFV at the moment is running on 6 blockchains; using Chainlink CCIP, Functions, Automation and Price Feeds all at the same time. The most difficuly challange was testing all these components together in multiple chains. Accomplishments that we're proud of CCFV successfully integrates funding campaigns and voting mechanisms across multiple blockchain ecosystems, fostering a unified and accessible platform for decentralized collaboration. The protocol handles this using Chainlink CCIP, Functions, Automation and Price Feeds in a harmonized integration. What we learned My experience with CCFV has been a rich learning journey, marked by accomplishments and insights. A standout learning opportunity was our adept use of Chainlink components across seven different blockchains. This hands-on experience expanded our technical know-how, teaching us the intricacies of decentralized oracles, data aggregation, and secure cross-chain interoperability. What's next for CCFV: CrossChain Funding and Voting Looking ahead, CCFV is dedicated to continuous improvement and growth. Our roadmap includes expanding cross-chain support to embrace a more diverse user base, introducing advanced governance features for enhanced user control, and prioritizing user experience improvements based on valuable feedback.
