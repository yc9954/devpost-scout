# Qwen Memory Agent

> A memory agent on Qwen Cloud that decides for itself what to remember, forget, and recall — and proves it drops stale facts with a reproducible benchmark, not a demo anecdote.

## Body

architecture What inspired it Every agent that talks to a user more than once hits the same wall: where do memories live, when should stale ones be dropped, and how do you fit the right memories into a limited context window? Most "memory" demos either stuff the whole history into the prompt — expensive, and it drags in outdated facts — or do naive top-k RAG, which has no notion of "this preference was replaced last week." I wanted to treat memory as a measurable engineering problem , not a party trick, and prove the behaviour with numbers. What it does Qwen MemoryAgent is a persistent-memory agent on Qwen Cloud that accumulates experience across sessions and makes increasingly accurate decisions: Agentic memory via Qwen function-calling. The agent itself decides when to call remember / recall / forget through Qwen's tool-calling — it's an agent with memory, not a database with an LLM bolted on. Supersession-aware forgetting. When a new fact contradicts an older one, the old record is retired ( superseded_by ) so retrieval stops surfacing the stale value. An exact (subject, type) match handles the clean case; a cosine-similarity pass catches near-paraphrases the model filed under a different subject. Graded decay + reinforce-on-recall. Memories fade over time on a per-type half-life unless recall reinforces them — so the working set stays focused on what's still used, and truly stale memories are forgotten. Pinned types (user preferences) never decay. Budget-constrained recall. Retrieval scores memories by \( \alpha\cdot\text{cosine} + \beta\cdot\text{recency} + \gamma\cdot\text{effective salience} + \delta\cdot\text{type prior} \) and greedily packs them until a configurable token budget is hit. Real token observability. Every answer reports what it actually cost ( GET /usage + a usage field per /chat ), using Qwen's real usage object rather than estimates. Portable memory. Export the store to a human-readable MEMORY.md index and a JSON snapshot; import to restore it — memory survives restarts and moves between machines. MCP-native. The memory tools are a FastMCP server, so any MCP client can drive the same engine. How I built it A FastAPI backend runs the agent loop, a FastMCP server, and the memory engine, backed by Qdrant , deployed on Alibaba Cloud ECS (Singapore). It calls Qwen Cloud / DashScope over the OpenAI-compatible endpoint — qwen-plus for the reasoning loop, text-embedding-v3 for vectors. The whole test suite is fully offline (mocked Qwen + in-memory Qdrant), so development cost zero API credits . I worked architecture-first on one model and handed bounded, spec'd implementation to a second via a handoff lane gated by pytest, test-integrity, and mutation testing . The benchmark (the proof) Synthetic multi-session personas state preferences, update some (the supersession test), and inject distractors; a held-out query set asks for the current preference. Four systems are scored — B0 no-memory, B1 full-history stuffing, B2 naive top-k, B3 ours — on context recall (retrieval-level, model-free) and staleness rate (retrieved context contains a superseded fact; lower is better), across a shrinking token budget with all systems competing under the same ceiling. Budget 8 16 32 64 B1 full-history — recall / stale 0.000 / 0.250 0.375 / 0.250 0.958 / 0.250 1.000 / 0.250 B2 naive top-k — recall / stale 0.875 / 0.125 1.000 / 0.250 1.000 / 0.250 1.000 / 0.250 B3 ours — recall / stale 1.000 / 0.000 1.000 / 0.000 1.000 / 0.000 1.000 / 0.000 (B0 no-memory scores 0.000 recall at every budget — it retrieves nothing.) B3 holds context recall 1.000 and staleness 0.000 at every budget. The sharpest finding is what happens to the baseline: B2's staleness rises with budget (0.125 → 0.250). With no supersession, giving naive RAG more room actively pulls retired facts back in. Only B3 stays current and small — measured, not asserted. The harder proof (including the misses) Recall benchmarks saturate, so I also measured whether the agent uses memory. Ten multi-session scenarios seed constraints (including superseded ones) and demand a decision in a later session, each graded by three independent oracles: the decision outcome, the store state via /memory/export , and recall-before-decision in the tool-call trace. A lucky guess that never consulted memory scores zero. Live on the ECS deployment, against real Qwen with a fresh store: task_success 0.60 — inside the 40–60% band MemoryArena (arXiv 2602.16313) reports for agents that ace passive recall. I publish the number and the full triage: three named defects — decision turns that skip recall, a generic-subject supersession collision, and a sub-threshold paraphrase band — each with a designed fix in the README and docs/design/memory-governance.md . The gap between recall 1.000 and active use 0.60 is the finding. Measured, not asserted, including the misses. What I learned Mutation testing earns its keep. All-passing behavioural tests still left numeric constants (decay half-lives, a token-fallback branch) un-pinned — the mutation gate caught each one. Benchmark honesty is a discipline. My first graded run disproved the headline because a distractor's keyword collided with the staleness metric. The engine was right; the measuring stick was contaminated. Fixing the instrument, not the result, is the job. Subject assignment is the weak joint. Supersession depends on the model choosing a stable subject key, and it doesn't always — which is exactly why the cosine path exists, and exactly where the remaining failures live. Two different token numbers do two different jobs — tiktoken for packing a budget, the API's real usage for measuring spend. Conflating them hides cost. Challenges Keeping the whole thing testable and zero-spend on a finite free credit budget; a cardless ECS deploy (solved via the free trial); and shipping to Singapore over UK-latency SSH. <div
