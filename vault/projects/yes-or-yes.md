## Body

hotel setup Fish tracking Fish decisions Inspiration We wanted the most unhinged possible use of 36 hours. The premise: take an actual fish tank with three real guppies and put it in charge of a real human's real life — over the phone, in real time, with real consequences on a real MacBook. No prompt, no UI, no off-ramp. The fish decide, your computer obeys. What it does You call a Twilio number. A snarky AI fish picks up. You tell it about something going on in your life — a breakup, a meeting you forgot, the job you just lost. The fish picks two options for you, one slightly bad and one catastrophically bad, and shows them on a TV mounted behind a real fish tank. Three guppies swim around. Whichever side of the tank the majority of fish are on when the countdown ends, that is the option that wins. A second MacBook then actually does the thing — sends the iMessage, drafts the Outlook email, posts to LinkedIn — while you watch on the TV. The fish are not a metaphor. The fish are the decision-maker. How we built it Four runtimes glued together with a realtime bus: bridge (Node on Fly.io) — Twilio Media Streams ↔ Deepgram (STT) ↔ Claude Haiku 4.5 ↔ ElevenLabs (TTS). Claude exposes four tools: present_options , wait_for_decision , dispatch_action , report_done . vision (Python on a Mac mini) — DJI Osmo Pocket 3 capture, OpenCV blob detection across the tank, publishing per-frame fish-position counts at 30 Hz. web (Next.js on Vercel) — /display page rendered on the TV, orchestration HTTP API, Redis state, Pusher pub/sub. Implements the vote rule (1-second rolling majority). remote-agent (Node on a second MacBook) — subscribes to dispatch events, runs scripted Playwright + osascript flows per scenario. Originally Anthropic Computer Use; we rewrote it as scripted runners after "60 seconds of an LLM clicking around" got too slow for a live demo. Five Pusher channels tie it together: fish-pos , options , decisions , agent-tasks , agent-status . Challenges we ran into Fish do not respect software deadlines. Real guppies sometimes hover dead-center for 5 seconds while a countdown ticks. We added a 1-second rolling-majority vote rule so a single confused fish doesn't tie the election. OpenCV kept fusing two close fish into one blob. Beefed up morphology with dilation and split logic. LinkedIn hydrates after the share-box renders , so click("Start a post") would fire on a not-yet-interactive element. Added overlay-dismissal and a force: true click fallback. Claude wanted to freelance on options. Locking the persona to three verbatim, non-negotiable scenarios fixed the drift. An unmatched dispatch text once silently fell through to a default stage script that opened twitter.com. We removed the fallback entirely so unrecognized text now no-ops instead of going to the wrong site. Accomplishments that we're proud of A real phone number that, when called, results in a real LinkedIn post written by an AI being approved by three real fish. Sub-second perceived latency end-to-end on the call. A scripted Playwright runner that completes a full scenario in ~5 seconds (down from ~60s of computer-use clicking around). Three guppies who, against all odds, made decisions we did not regret in front of an audience. What we learned Realtime fan-out across four runtimes is much easier with one Pusher channel per concern than one giant channel-of-everything. "Computer use" is great for capability demos and miserable for live demos. Scripted automation, when the surface area is fixed, wins on speed and reliability every time. Fish are surprisingly good product managers. Decisive. No scope creep. What's next for YES? or YES! Per-fish identity tracking, so you can vote with a specific guppy instead of a per-side blob count. A leaderboard of regrets. <div
