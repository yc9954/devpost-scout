How to Play Splash image Be sure to check it out here on reddit: r/Sneakle Inspiration Inspired by Boggle, Squaredle, Bananagrams, and Battleship, Sneakle takes the classic "spell a word from a mix of letters" and brings in a Wordle-like Battleship element of finding the one hidden word. What it does Sneakle is a daily game that challenges players to complete the "Daily Sneakle" each day, tasking them to find a hidden word amongst a grid of letters. Swipe across letters to spell out a guess. (Swipe in any direction!) Guessing will show you which letters are IN the SECRET word, and which AREN'T. Deduce the SECRET word to win! Compete on the daily leaderboards to show your Sneakle prowess! Additionally, players can access an "unlimited" game mode, to endlessly challenge themselves. Sneakle also tracks per-player stats, and per-puzzle stats. On the reddit side, Sneakle has many moderation tools available, from adding/managing the queue of daily puzzles, to editing existing posts' postData, and importing/exporting puzzle JSON data. How I built it Using GameMaker's new Reddit export, I was able to bring my Sneakle prototype to life right on Reddit. Following templates, open source server code, and working with the Discord, I was able to flesh out my game and juice it up into something I'm proud of! What I learned This was my first time writing any server-side code, and it really expanded my understanding of good client/server patterns. What's next for Sneakle I'd love to continue development, with plans for adding a user-created "Community"-tagged puzzle builder, creating an easy-to-browse archive view, and allowing for a light-mode theme. <div
