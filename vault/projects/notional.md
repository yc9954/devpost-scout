## Body

Inspiration The release of Chainlink Functions got us thinking about which Web2 applications could be augmented by or bridged to Web3. Replit's payment model came to mind where developers can outsource tasks to other devs by assigning a 'bounty' to the task. We were inspired by this model of 'bountification' or 'gig economy' of work, and the idea that smart contracts can plug into Web2 systems to create a hybrid of Web2 and Web3. We knew that systems like GitHub already existed for team collaboration, however GitHub was missing automated payments. So we created an app which 'plugs into' GitHub and allows existing teams to benefit from the advantages of Web3 payments without switching to an entirely new platform. What it does Notional is a helper app to GitHub for incentivising development of issues in GitHub repos. It helps teams delegate work amongst themselves using a pay-by-task model. Repo Owners can create ‘bounties’ on GitHub issues, and Devs can score the bounties by resolving issues. This creates a marketplace of issues / issue-solvers and can help streamline the development of software projects. The app can be used by regular software teams to automate their payments, or outsource work, and DAOs can benefit from the app's decentralisation to commission work in a more trustless way. In the app, owners of GitHub repos can sign in and connect their wallets. The app displays the open Github issues in their Repositories. They can create bounties for each issue, and these bounties are available to developers or ‘bounty hunters’. Repo Owners can also cancel their bounties and withdraw the payments if the bounty is not yet closed. Developer or ‘bounty hunters’ can also sign in and connect their wallets. They can see a list of open bounties in a repository, with the payment amounts shown. Each bounty also links to the GitHub page for that issue. This serves as a dashboard for Developers to find work. When the GitHub username they registered to the platform creates a successful Pull Request, which closes a bounty issue, the Developer is paid the bounty. How we built it We have a javascript frontend which interfaces with our smart contract backend. It also tracks created/cancelled bounties by using The Graph to index the on-chain Escrow contracts. The app connects to our Main contract, which stores information about users and is the main control centre for the other contracts. It acts as the ‘Escrow factory’, and generates the Escrow contracts which hold payments. When creating a bounty on an issue, the issue ID and repository information, as well as the payment, are passed through Main to deploy a new ‘Escrow’ contract. There is one Escrow contract deployed per bounty. Each Escrow contract calls the Chainlink Functions Consumer to query the GitHub API. It does this by passing in the issue ID and repo information to the Functions script, and then the Functions script calls the GitHub API. The script performs a search for merged pull requests in the specified repo, and iterates through the commits of each PR to check if the PR is linked to the relevant issue. If a commit message of a merged PR contains the issue ID, we return the author of the PR. Github usernames are associated with wallet addresses in a mapping in Main, so this can be used to lookup the wallet address from the Author returned by Chainlink Functions. We used Hardhat to test and deploy all our contracts. Challenges we ran into We experienced issues when trying to call our Chainlink Functions request both from an on-chain source and directly from web3.js. The error was ‘cannot estimate gas’ when calling our ‘executeRequest’ method in the Consumer. Despite manually setting a gasLimit, we could not get it to work. However, the Functions script was confirmed to work when simulated in the Functions-Hardhat-Starter-Kit. If completed, our Functions would have triggered a payment from Escrow to the author of the merged PR by looking up the author name in the username-address mapping in Main. This would mean that any registered Dev could receive payout just by submitting a successful PR for the issue. We spent a lot of time trying to fix the above issue, which meant we also ran out of time to implement Chainlink Automation. We would have added an automated call to a method which iterates through each Escrow, and prompts each one to make a Functions request. The status of every bounty would be checked every hour, so if a developer performs a task, they would be paid within the hour. Accomplishments that we're proud of We are proud of learning about Chainlink Functions, given that it is a new technology with a lot of potential. We are also proud that we were able to build a web interface with Web3 elements that could interface with smart contracts/The Graph as a backend as opposed to a traditional database. It was great to make our ideals of decentralisation and automation tangible. What we learned We learned about Chainlink Functions and how it can be used to merge Web2 and Web3. We also gained experience in international group collaboration, being an international team separated by 7 hours. We learned more about project pacing, and how to ask good questions! What's next for Notional We want Notional to be able to check GitHub and make payouts automatically. Ideally it should be in a state where bounties can flow seamlessly to developers who are achieving the tasks. A notification system such as automated emails (through Chainlink Functions) could notify users of changes to their bounties / bounties they have completed. Users could also build up an on-chain record of bounties they have achieved. This would serve as an indicator of past earnings and rates, and development ability. We will develop for different work distribution models. Notional can become a place where development work is outsourced to any developer in the world - not necessarily just developers focused on a particular repo. For developers, the app would become a platform where they can seek work from a variety of different projects with work available. A global open marketplace for development work, where all the financial infrastructure is on-chain. We would also like to build a toolkit that helps groups of people and DAOs to be able to assign bounties. Approval of whether a task is completed could be done by DAO vote, ‘Required Approvers’ on GitHub, or some other consensus forming mechanism. This would give DAOs the tools they need to pay for their own development in a more trustless way. <div
